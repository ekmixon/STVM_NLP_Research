# Research code on deep learning for natural language processing/sentiment analysis
---
## The goal of this project is to explore ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of neural networks for NLP/sentiment analysis
Check our research paper [Can you tell? SSNet - a Sagittal Stratum-inspired Neural Network
  Framework for Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12958) for context and details .
