SSNet workflow with input and output data description

1. Split IMDB labeled train data into 20K and 5K. Make sure the split data is balanced. I.e, pos and pos reviews are evenly split in both files.
Source code: STVM_NLP_Research\model_c_d\misc-src\split-imdb-train-dataset.ipynb
Input: STVM_NLP_Research\model_c_d\IMDB\data\imdb_master.zip. Uncompress the file as imdb_master.csv before running.
Output 1: data\imdb_train_split_20000.csv
Output 2: data\imdb_train_split_5000.csv

2. Train individual models.

Model_1 BowTie:
Trained on 20K dataset. The prediction file on 5K: "data/model_a_5ktrain.csv" and on 25K: "data/model_a_25ktest.csv"

Model_2 BiLSTM:
Trained on 20K dataset. The prediction file on 5K: "data/model_b_5ktrain.csv" and on 25K: "data/model_b_25ktest.csv"


Model_3 Bert model:
Trained on 20K dataset. The prediction file on 5K: "data/model_c_5ktrain.csv" and on 25K: "data/model_c_25ktest.csv"


Model_4 USE model:
Trained on 20K dataset. The prediction file on 5K: "data/model_d_5ktrain.csv" and on 25K: "data/model_d_25ktest.csv"


3. Combine participating models
Source Code files:
	1) combiners/SSNet_predictions.py: run this file for evaluating accuracy of all the methods proposed in the paper
	2) combiners/SSNet_Neural_Network.py: neural network combiner
	3) combiners/SSNet_Bayesian_Decision.py: bayesian decision combiner
	4) combiners/SSNet_Heuristic_Hybrid.py: heuristic hybrid combiner

Use following instructions to run the combiner:
1) The combiner implementation consists of four files placed in the directory "combiners". The file "SSNet_predictions.py" expects 5K train data and probabilities predicted on tain and test data by all the four models. Currently all these required files are placed inside the data folder. Please note that file names may be little different, please rename if required before next step
2) Run "SSNet_predictions.py"
3) It could take a while to complete the three proposed methods but once done the output will produce all the accuracies 
4) The output contains train (5K) accuracy and test accuracy (25K)
5) There would be minor changes in accuracy for neural network combiner
