SSNet workflow with input and output data description

1. Split IMDB labeled train data into 20K and 5K. Make sure the split data is balanced. I.e, pos and pos reviews are evenly split in both files.
Source code: STVM_NLP_Research\model_c_d\misc-src\split-imdb-train-dataset.ipynb
Input: STVM_NLP_Research\model_c_d\IMDB\data\imdb_master.zip. Uncompress the file as imdb_master.csv before running.
Output 1: STVM_NLP_Research\data\imdb_train_split_20000.csv
Output 2: STVM_NLP_Research\data\imdb_train_split_5000.csv

2. Train individual models.

Model_3 Bert model: 
Source code: STVM_NLP_Research\model_c_d\IMDB\model_c_bert.ipynb
Input: STVM_NLP_Research\model_c_d\IMDB\data\imdb_master.zip. Uncompress the file as imdb_master.csv before running.
Output 1: A trained model using 20K train data (same reviews as in STVM_NLP_Research\data\imdb_train_split_20000.csv).
Output 2: STVM_NLP_Research\data\model_bert_result_split_5000_20000.csv. This file has prediction probability for every review in split train data of 5K (same reviews as in STVM_NLP_Research\data\imdb_train_split_5000.csv) using the model created in output 1.
Output 3: STVM_NLP_Research\data\model_bert_result_split_25000_20000.csv. This file has prediction probability for every review in IMDB test dataset of 25K using the model created in output 1.

Model_4 USE model:
Source code: STVM_NLP_Research\model_c_d\IMDB\model_d_use.ipynb
Input: STVM_NLP_Research\model_c_d\IMDB\data\imdb_master.zip. Uncompress the file as imdb_master.csv before running.
Output 1: A trained model using 20K train data (same reviews as in STVM_NLP_Research\data\imdb_train_split_20000.csv).
Output 2: STVM_NLP_Research\data\model_use_result_split_5000_20000.csv. This file has prediction probability for every review in split train data of 5K (same reviews as in STVM_NLP_Research\data\imdb_train_split_5000.csv) using the model created in output 1.
Output 3: STVM_NLP_Research\data\model_use_result_split_25000_20000.csv. This file has prediction probability for every review in IMDB test dataset of 25K using the model created in output 1.

3. Combine participating models
Source code: TODO: please fill in
Input 1: participating individual model created prediction files using train 5K (same reviews as in STVM_NLP_Research\data\imdb_train_split_5000.csv). Use this 5K predictions to train combining weights.
Input 2: participating individual model created prediction files using test dataset of 25K.
Output: 
Output: Final combined predictions and performance from participating models on test dataset of 25K.
